              After breakfast, we went to Ewha Womans University,
              which is one of the most popular and beautiful universities in Seoul.
              We are not the type of people who like to take a lot of pretty pics.
              So instead of taking photos, we walked and enjoyed the gorgeous campus.
            </p>

              I didn’t bring enough clothes to Seoul
              because I planned to buy clothes there and wore them immediately.
              So, we had to go shopping, lol.
              There was a street close to the university that was famous for shopping.
              We spent a lot of time and bought A LOT OF clothes there.

        <div id="lunch">
          <p id="bulbap">
            We also had our lunch, Bulbap, there.
            At first, it looked like a hotpot with a bunch of cheese in it.
            After finishing the hotpot, the clerk came and added some rice to it.
            Then, hotpot turned into fried rice! We were surprised! It tasted so good!
            The fried rice was quite crunchy and it had some cheese taste in it.
            If I can go to Seoul again, I definitely will go Bulbap again!

      <h3>HONGDAE</h3>
      <article id="hongdae">
        <p id="hongdae-text">
          We went to the famous shopping area in Seoul -- -- Hongdae.
          Yes, we went shopping again lol. But unfortunately, the weather wasn’t good.
          It was pouring. So, we didn’t take many photos lol.
          But we bought some shoes there, or maybe only me? Lol.
          For dinner, we had Korean bbq -- -- Tong Tong.
          I was excited about the Korean bbq, and it didn’t let me down!
          Korean bbq is the best!
