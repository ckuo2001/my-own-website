            <p id="text-one">The first stop for the second day was Dongdaemun, where is famous for its shopping area.
              We not only went shopping, but also we walked along the Cheonggyecheon stream.
              The weather was really hot, but we felt so relaxed just walking and looking at the water.
              No need to worry about anything!

          <p id="text-two">After that, we went to have our first lunch in Seoul - Jin Ok Hwa Original Chicken.
            The moment we sat down, the waitress put the big pot with a whole chicken in it in front of us.
            We were shocked because it was A LOT! However, we still finished it because it was so good!
            The chicken was so tender, and the rice cake is also really soft!
            We all recommend this restaurant!

          After having lunch, we went to the landmark of Seoul - Seoul Tower!
          I really wanted to go to Seoul Tower because of its beutiful sight!
          Also, many K-drama were filmed at the tower.
          It was one of the places that I really looked forward to.
          However, the weather wasn't good. It was kind of foggy up there...
          But we still have good times on there. We enjoyed the sun and the wind up there.
          Also, we bought some banana and strawberry flavored milk drink! Taste so good!

        <div id="cheese">
          <img src="img/korea 2/IMG_7924.jpg">
          <p id="text-three">
            Walking for the whole day, we were so hungry.
            Ｗe went back to Myeong-dong to have our dinner (pictures on the left).
            The cheese tasted so good, especially with the meat and rice cake!
            Finishing the meat and rice cake, the waiter put some rice in our pot,
            and it became fried rice!
            It was a big portion for three people. We were so full after dinner lol
