    <h1><span class="red">My trip</span> to <span class="blue">Seoul, Korea</span> !</h1>
    <p>
      As a kpop girl, I always wanted to go to Seoul with my friends.
      since I was 9th grade, I have started to watch k-dramas and listen to kpop.
      Kpop always cheers people up because of its exciting rhythm and cool dancing.
      Also, my friends really like cosmetics from Korea.
      Thus, travelling to Korea became our dreams.

    <p>
      After graduating from high school, my friends and I decided to go to Seoul by ourselves.
      The dream from 10th grade finally came true.
      We planned for a long time and eventually booked the ticket and started our journey!

        <h3>TIRING STAIRS...</h3>
        <p>
          After arriving in Seoul, we went to our hostel immediately.
          The thing that really shocked me was that some exit for the subway station didn't have eccelator.
          We needed to carry our own laugage and climb up the stairs.
          It was so tired that I couldn't forget it.

        <h3>FIRST MEAL IN SEOUL!</h3>

            <span id="text-one">
              After checking in our room, it was almost dinner time.
              We lived close to Myeong-dong, so our first meal in Seoul was Sinseon Seolnongtang in Myeong-dong.

              It was good but too light for me. You can taste milk when you eat and the rice in it is really soft.
              The portion is kind of big but it's not expensive.

        <h3>MYEONG-DONG SHOPPING AREA XD</h3>
        <p>
          After dinner, we went to shopping. Myeong-dong is a place where gathers many different things.
          You can find cosmetics, food, snacks, clothes, even book stores here.
          It was really tiring after climbing up the stairs with our suitcases,
          but we still went shopping until 11 pm that night.
